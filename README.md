## Get started

1. Once cloned, run `npm install` to install 11ty and other dependencies. Then run `npm start` to run both 11ty and sass in watch mode. Use `npm run build` to run a production version.

1. Open `src/_data/meta.js` and adjust the values to your details.

1. Edit `src/index.njk` to change the home page - including changing the template type if desired and then create content within `_pages` using any templating format you prefer to add content.

1. Review the [11ty documentation](https://11ty.dev) to more deeply apply customizations, including adding custom data sources and reviewing what template languages are available.
